washington,"Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide. Left him with nothin but ruined pride, something new inside, a voice saying, “You gotta fend for yourself.” he started retreatin and readin every treatise on the shelf. Me? I trusted him. We are outgunned, outmanned, outnumbered, outplanned. We gotta make an all out stand ayo, Im gonna need a right-hand man. Check it— Can I be real a second? For just a millisecond? Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second? Now Im the model of a modern major general, the venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all lining up, to put me up on a pedestal, writin letters to relatives embellishin my elegance and eloquence, but the elephant is in the room, the truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go… Any hope of success is fleeting, how can I keep leading when the people Im leading keep retreating? We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn, knight takes rook, but look, We are outgunned, outmanned, outnumbered, outplanned. We gotta make an all out stand ayo, Im gonna need a right-hand man. Incoming! Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and… Goes the cannon, were abandonin Kips Bay and… Theres another ship and… We just lost the southern tip and… We gotta run to Harlem quick, we cant afford another slip. Guns and horses giddyup, I decide to divvy up my forces, theyre skittish as the British cut the city up. This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny, I scream in the face of this mass mutiny: are these the men with which I am to defend America? We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance. I cannot be everywhere at once, people. Im in dire need of assistance… Who are you? As you were. Huh. Yes? Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr? Burr? Close the door on your way out. On the contrary. I called you here because our odds are beyond scary. Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh. Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff? Dont get me wrong, youre a young man, of great renown. I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown. Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire you… Whyre you upset? Its alright, you want to fight, youve got a hunger. I was just like you when I was younger. Head full of fantasies of dyin like a martyr? Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder. Im being honest. Im working with a third of what our Congress has promised. We are a powder keg about to explode, I need someone like you to lighten the load. So? Son, We are outgunned, outmanned! Outnumbered, outplanned! And his right hand man! The cavalrys not coming. Alex, listen. Theres only one way for us to win this. Provoke outrage, outright. Dont engage, strike by night. Remain relentless ‘til their troops take flight. Outrun. Outlast. Hit ‘em quick, get out fast. Stay alive ‘til this horror show is past. Were gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast. No. Evryone attack! Attack! What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet! Im sorry, is this not your speed?! Hamilton! Have Lafayette take the lead! Dont do a thing. History will prove him wrong. We have a war to fight, lets move along. What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General. Lee, you will never agree with me, but believe me, these young men dont speak for me. Thank you for your service. Hamilton! Meet me inside. Son— This war is hard enough without infighting— You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south. Son— Watch your tone. I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown. My names been through a lot, I can take it. No— Or you could die and we need you alive. Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive— Go home, Alexander. Thats an order from your commander. Go home. We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts. I know. Hamilton! Hamilton! Hamilton! Hamilton! I need my right hand man back! Alexander Hamilton, troops are waiting in the field for you. If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide. Oh, Alexander Hamilton, I have soldiers who will yield for you. If we manage to get this right, theyll surrender by early light. The world will never be the same, Alexander… I was younger then you are now when I was given my first command. I led my men straight into a massacre. I witnessed their deaths firsthand. I made every mistake, I felt the shame rise in me, And even now I lie awake, Knowing history has its eyes on me. History has its eyes on me. Let me tell you what I wish Id known when I was young and dreamed of glory: You have no control: Who lives, who dies, who tells your story. I know that we can win. I know that greatness lies in you. But remember from here on in, History has its Eyes on you. Not. Yet. We won! They are asking me to lead. I am doing the best I can to get the people that I need, Im asking you to be my right hand man. I know its a lot to ask, To leave behind the world you know… Treasury. History has its eyes… on… you!  Mr. Jefferson, welcome home. Mr. Jefferson, welcome home. Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight, but youre here with us in New York City. Are you ready for a cabinet meeting???  The issue on the table: Secretary Hamiltons plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir. Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary Hamilton, your response. Excuse me? Jefferson, Madison, take a walk! Hamilton, take a walk! Well reconvene after a brief recess. Hamilton! A word. You wanna pull yourself together? Young man, Im from Virginia, so watch your mouth. You need the votes. No, you need to convince more folks. Winning was easy, young man. Governings harder. You have to find a compromise. Convince them otherwise. I imagine theyll call for your removal. Figure it out, Alexander. Thats an order from your commander. What do you want, Burr? What do you want, Burr? If you stand for nothing,  Burr, then what do you fall for? The issue on the table: France is on the verge of war with England. Do we provide aid and troops to our French allies or do we stay out of it? Remember, my decision on this matter is not subject to congressional approval. The only person you have to convince is me. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir. Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary Hamilton, your response. Enough. Hamilton is right. Were too fragile to start another fight. Sure, when the French figure out whos gonna lead ‘em. The people are rioting. Theres a difference. Frankly, its a little disquieting you would let your ideals blind you to reality. Hamilton. Draft a statement of neutrality. Hamilton! I know youre busy. I wanna give you a word of warning. Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning. I need a favor. Shh. Talk less. I need you to draft an address. No, hes stepping down so he can run for President. Im stepping down. Im not running for President. One last time. Relax, have a drink with me one last time. Lets take a break tonight and then well teach them how to say goodbye, to say goodbye. You and I. I wanna talk about neutrality. I want to warn against partisan fighting. Pick up a pen, start writing. I wanna talk about what I have learned. The hard-won wisdom I have earned. No! One last time the people will hear from me one last time and if we get this right were gonna teach ‘em how to say goodbye. You and I— No, they will see were strong. So Ill use it to move them along. If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on. It outlives me when Im gone. Like the scripture says: “Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid.” Theyll be safe in the nation weve made. I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree. A moment alone in the shade, at home in this nation weve made. One last time. The hope View them with indulgence After forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal Consigned to oblivion, as I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.  I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking, in the midst of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws Under a free government, the ever-favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I trust,  Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers. One last time. You and I Going home History has its eyes on you Were gonna teach ‘em how to say goodbye! Teach ‘em how to say goodbye! To say goodbye! Say goodbye! One last time!  Let me tell you what I wish Id known when I was young and dreamed of glory. You have no control: Who lives, who dies, who tells your story? Who lives, who dies, who tells your story? Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?

madison,"Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned, our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain, put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain, and he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain. Thomas, we are engaged in a battle for our nations very soul. Can you get us out of the mess were in? Hamiltons new financial plan is nothing less than government control. Ive been fighting for the South alone. Where have you been? We have to win. Oww You dont have the votes. You dont have the votes. Youre gonna need congressional approval and you dont have the votes. Why he even brings the thunder… Hamilton! Maybe we can solve one problem with another and win a victory for the Southerners, in other words— A quid pro quo. Wouldnt you like to work a little closer to home? Well, I propose the Potomac. Well, well see how it goes. What do you want, Burr? What do you want, Burr? If you stand for nothing,  Burr, then what do you fall for? France. Which I wrote. The ink hasnt dried. It must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side. So hes doubled the size of the government. Wasnt the trouble with much our previous government size? Follow the scent of his enterprise. If we dont stop it we aid and abet it. Somebody has to stand up for the South! You cant put it out from inside the house. Oh! This immigrant isnt somebody we chose. Oh! This immigrants keeping us all on our toes. Oh! Lets show these Federalists who theyre up against! Oh! Southern motherfuckin— Democratic-Republicans! Oh! Lets follow the money and see where it goes. Because every second the Treasury grows. If we follow the money and see where it leads, get in the weeds, look for the seeds of Hamiltons misdeeds. It must be nice. It must be nice. Follow the money and see where it goes. It must be nice. It must be nice. We wont be invisible. We wont be denied. Still, it must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side. This is great! Hes out of power. He holds no office. And he just destroyed President John Adams, the only other significant member of his party. Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different amounts… You are uniquely situated by virtue of your position— To seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred mission— I can almost see the headline, your career is done. Ya best gwan run back where ya come from. Confess. Unless? Um, yes. Gentlemen, lets go. The people wont know what we know. Have you read this? Alexander Hamilton had a torrid affair. And he wrote it down right there. Highlights! Damn! “I had frequent meetings with her. Most of them at my own house.” At his own house! No… Have you read this? Never gon be President now. Never gon be President now. Never gon be President now. Thats one less thing to worry about! Well, hes never gon be President now. Well, hes never gon be President now. Well, hes never gon be President now. Thats one less thing to worry about. Hey! At least he was honest with our money! Have you read this? You ever see somebody ruin their own life? Please? Aaron Burr! Hes very attractive in the North. New Yorkers like his chances. Ask him a question: it glances off, he obfuscates, he dances. Thomas thats the problem, see, they see Burr as a less extreme you. You need to change course, a key endorsement might redeem you. Dont laugh. You used to work on the same staff. It might be nice, it might be nice to get Hamilton on your side. It might be nice, it might be nice To get Hamilton on your side. Its a tie! Its up to Hamilton! Jefferson or Burr?  Choose, Choose, Choose! Oh! Oh! Oh! Well, Ill be damned. Well, Ill be damned. Hamiltons on your side. You won in a landslide. Its crazy that the guy who comes in second becomes vice President. Why? He took our country from bankruptcy to prosperity.

The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind.  But Im not afraid. I know who I married. So long as you come home at the end of the day that would be enough.  We dont need a legacy. We dont need money. If I could grant you peace of mind,  If you could let me inside your heart… Oh, let me be a part of the narrative in the story they will write someday. Let this moment be the first chapter: where you decide to stay and I could be enough and we could be enough that would be enough. Look at where you are. Look at where you started.

Theres a lake I know In a nearby park You and I can go Take a break and get away— Lets go upstate where we can stay. Sometimes thats how it goes. Im sure he already knows. Further down, New York— Our Senator!...  His poor wife. I saved every letter you wrote me. From the moment I read them I knew you were mine. You said you were mine. I thought you were mine.  Do you know what Angelica said when we saw your first letter arrive? She said,  “Be careful with that one, love. He will do what it takes to survive.”  You and your words flooded my senses. Your sentences left me defenseless. You built me palaces out of paragraphs, you built cathedrals. Im re-reading the letters you wrote me. Im searching and scanning for answers in every line, for some kind of sign, and when you were mine the world seemed to  Burn. Burn.  You published the letters she wrote you. You told the whole world how you brought this girl into our bed. In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives. Do you know what Angelica said When she read what youd done? She said, “You have married an Icarus. He has flown too close to the sun.”  You and your words, obsessed with your legacy... Your sentences border on senseless, and you are paranoid in every paragraph how they perceive you, You, you, you…  Im erasing myself from the narrative. Let future historians wonder how Eliza reacted when you broke her heart. You have torn it all apart. I am watching it burn. Watching it burn. The world has no right to my heart. The world has no place in our bed. They dont get to know what I said. Im burning the memories, Burning the letters that might have redeemed you. You forfeit all rights to my heart. You forfeit the place in our bed. You sleep in your office instead, with only the memories of when you were mine. I hope that you burn. No! Is he breathing? Is he going to survive this?

hamilton,"Alexander Hamilton. My name is Alexander Hamilton. And theres a million things I havent done, but just you wait, just you wait... Just you wait! Just you wait! Just you wait! Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir? Oh, well, sure, sir, Im Alexander Hamilton, Im at your service, sir. I have been looking for you. Sir… I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. Its a blur, sir. He handles the financials? Yes! I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, Im not stupid.  So howd you do it? Howd you graduate so fast? Youre an orphan. Of course! Im an orphan. God, I wish there was a war! Then we could prove that were worth more than anyone bargained for… That would be nice. What? Ha. You cant be serious. Yes. If you stand for nothing, Burr, whatll you fall for? I am not throwing away my shot! I am not throwing away my shot! Hey yo, Im just like my country, Im young, scrappy and hungry, and Im not throwing away my shot! Im ‘a get a scholarship to Kings College. I probly shouldnt brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish. The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish. I gotta holler just to be heard. With every word, I drop knowledge! Im a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal tryin to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable. Only nineteen but my mind is older. These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder evry burden, evry disadvantage I have learned to manage, I dont have a gun to brandish, I walk these streets famished. The plan is to fan this spark into a flame. But damn, its getting dark, so let me spell out the name, I am the— A-l-e-x-a-n-d e-r—we are—meant to be… A colony that runs independently. Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin on us endlessly. Essentially, they tax us relentlessly, then King George turns around, runs a spending spree. He aint ever gonna set his descendants free, so there will be a revolution in this century. Enter me! Dont be shocked when your histry book mentions me. I will lay down my life if it sets us free. Eventually, youll see my ascendancy, And I am not throwing away my shot. I am not throwing away my shot. Hey yo, Im just like my country, Im young, scrappy and hungry and Im not throwing away my shot. I am not throwing away my shot. I am not throwing away my shot. Hey yo, Im just like my country, Im young, scrappy and hungry and Im not throwing away my shot. Its time to take a shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Burr, check what we got. Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot, I think your pants look hot, Laurens, I like you a lot. Lets hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin the pot... What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot, poppin a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not, a bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists? Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!  Oh, am I talkin too loud? Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth. I never had a group of friends before, I promise that Ill make yall proud. I am not throwing away my shot. I am not throwing away my shot. Hey yo, Im just like my country, Im young, scrappy and hungry and Im not throwing away my shot.  I am not throwing away my shot. I am not throwing away my shot. Hey yo, Im just like my country, Im young, scrappy and hungry and Im not throwing away my shot. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Yea! I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory Whens it gonna get me? In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me? If I see it comin, do I run or do I let it be? Is it like a beat without a melody? See, I never thought Id live past twenty. Where I come from some get half as many. Ask anybody why we livin fast and we laugh, reach for a flask, we have to make this moment last, thats plenty.   Scratch that, this is not a moment, its the movement where all the hungriest brothers with something to prove went? Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand, we roll like Moses, claimin our promised land. And? If we win our independence? ‘Zat a guarantee of freedom for our descendants? Or will the blood we shed begin an endless cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants? I know the action in the street is excitin, but Jesus, between all the bleedin ‘n fightin Ive been readin ‘n writin. We need to handle our financial situation. Are we a nation of states? Whats the state of our nation? Im past patiently waitin. Im passionately smashin every expectation, every actions an act of creation! Im laughin in the face of casualties and sorrow, for the first time, Im thinkin past tomorrow, And I am not throwing away my shot. I am not throwing away my shot. Hey yo, Im just like my country, Im young, scrappy and hungry and Im not throwing away my shot.  Time to take a shot!  Not throwin away my— I may not live to see our glory! But I will gladly join the fight! And when our children tell our story… Theyll tell the story of tonight. Lets have another round tonight. Theyll tell the story of tonight. No matter what they tell you. Tomorrow therell be more of us. Telling the story of tonight Theyll tell the story of tonight Theyll tell the story of tonight Theyll tell the story of tonight Yo!  Hed have you all unravel at the  sound of screams but the revolution is comin. The have-nots are gonna win this,  its hard to listen to you with a straight face. Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldnt even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n all that weve lost n you talk about Congress?! My dog speaks more eloquently than thee! But strangely, your mange is the same. Is he in Jersey? For the revolution! If you repeat yourself again Im gonna— Scream— Honestly, look at me, please dont read! Dont modulate the key then not debate with me! Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea? Burr, Id rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties. As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war. I knew that I was poor, I knew it was the only way to— Rise up! If they tell my story I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or— Rise up! We will fight for this land but theres only one man who can give us a command so we can— Rise up! Understand? Its the only way to— Rise up! Rise up! Here he comes! Theyre battering down the Battery check the damages. We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em of their advantages. Lets take a stand with the stamina God has granted us. Hamilton wont abandon ship, Yo, lets steal their cannons— Your excellency, you wanted to see me? Yes, sir. We keep meeting. Have I done something wrong, sir? Sir? Sir! To be their Secretary? I dont think so. Im not— Yes. Why are you telling me this? I am not throwin away my shot! I am not throwin away my shot! Ayo, Im just like my country, Im young, scrappy and hungry! I am not throwing away my shot! You need all the help you can get. I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan, Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else? Well need some spies on the inside, Some Kings men who might let some things slide. Ill write to Congress and tell ‘em we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise. Ill rise above my station, organize your information, ‘til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir! Rise up! Rise up! Rise up! What? Thats true. Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one? Hey Hey Hey hey Hey hey hey hey Where are you taking me? Then by all means, lead the way. Schuyler? If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it. Eliza, I dont have a dollar to my name, an acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame. All I haves my honor, a tolerance for pain, a couple of college credits and my top-notch brain. Insane, your family brings out a different side of me, Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me, no stress, my love for you is never in doubt. Well get a little place in Harlem and well figure it out. Ive been livin without a family since I was a child. My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild. But Ill never forget my mothers face, that was real, and long as Im alive, Eliza, swear to God,  youll never feel so… Eliza… Ive never felt so— My life is gon be fine cuz Elizas in it. Always—  Rewind— You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied. Youre like me. Im never satisfied. I have never been satisfied. Alexander Hamilton. Unimportant. Theres a million things I havent done but just you wait, just you wait… Where are you taking me? Then by all means, lead the way. Schuyler? If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it. To the groom! To the groom! To the groom!   To the bride! To the bride!  Angelica! Angelica!   By your side.   To the union!  To the revolution! Always—  Be satisfied,  be satisfied, Ho! Woo! Well, if it isnt Aaron Burr. I didnt think that you would make it. Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel. I wish I had your command instead of manning Georges journal. Yes, I do. Is that so? No, these guys should go. Leave us alone. Its alright, Burr. I wish youd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr. What do you mean? I see. Oh shit… I will never understand you. If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for? Ill see you on the other side of the war. I have never seen the General so despondent. I have taken over writing all his correspondence. Congress writes, “George, attack the British forces.” I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses. Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance, they only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence. Sir! Thats right. Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight. Outrun. Outlast. Chick-a-plao! Raise a glass! We cut supply lines, we steal contraband, we pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand. And evry day, “Sir, entrust me with a command,” and evry day, He dismisses me out of hand. Instead of me, Yeah. Hes not the choice I would have gone with. He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth. Ready, sir! Yes, sir! Charles Lee was left behind without a pot to piss in. He started sayin this to anybody who would listen: But, sir! I cant disobey direct orders. Laurens, do not throw away your shot. Its the Ten Duel Commandments. Your lieutenant when theres reckoning to be reckoned. Or negotiate a time and place. You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility. Leave a note for your next of kin. Tell ‘em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in. Your last chance to negotiate. Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight… Aaron Burr, sir. Sure. But your man has to answer for his words, Burr. Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous? Look ‘em in the eye, aim no higher. Summon all the courage you require. Then count Number Fire! Lee, do you yield? Go! We won. Sir! Dont call me son. Lee called you out. We called his bluff. Youre absolutely right. John should have shot him in the mouth. That wouldve shut him up. Im notcha son— Charles Lee, Thomas Conway, these men take your name and they rake it through the mud. Well, I dont have your name. I dont have your titles. I dont have your land. But, if you— If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war. Im more than willing to die— Call me son one more time— Sir— How long have you known? Eliza, you should have told me. No. You should have told me. The wars not done. Will you relish being a poor mans wife, unable to provide for your life? History has its eyes on me. History has its Eyes on you. Monsieur Lafayette. How you say, no sweat. Were finally on the field. Weve had quite a run. We get the job done. So what happens if we win? Well be with you when you do. See you on the other side. ‘Til the world turns upside down… I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory. This is where it gets me: on my feet, the enemy ahead of me. If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me, weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me. Then I remember my Elizas expecting me... not only that, my Elizas expecting. We gotta go, gotta get the job done, gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son! Take the bullets out your gun! The bullets out your gun! We move under cover and we move as one through the night, we have one shot to live another day. We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away. We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it. Its either that or meet the business end of a bayonet. The code word is ‘Rochambeau, dig me? You have your orders now, go, man, go! And so the American experiment begins with my friends all scattered to the winds. Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining bravry. Well never be free until we end slavery! When we finally drive the British away, Lafayette is there waiting— In Chesapeake Bay! How did we know that this plan would work? We had a spy on the inside. Thats right, Hercules Mulligan! After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet. We negotiate the terms of surrender. I see George Washington smile. We escort their men out of Yorktown. They stagger home single file. Tens of thousands of people flood the streets. There are screams and church bells ringing. And as our fallen foes retreat, I hear the drinking song theyre singing… Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son. We won! Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone. My son. Look at my son. Pride is not the word Im looking for.  There is so much more inside me now. Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun. My son. When you smile, I fall apart. And I thought I was so smart. My father wasnt around. I swear that Ill be around for you. Ill do whatever it takes. Ill make the world safe and sound for you… …will come of age with our young nation. Well bleed and fight for you, well make it right for you.  If we lay a strong enough foundation well pass it on to you, well give the world to you, and youll blow us all away... someday, someday. Yeah, youll blow us all away, someday, someday. A-after the war I went back to New York. I practiced law, Burr worked next door. Gentlemen of the jury, Im curious, bear with me. Are you aware that were making histry? This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation. The liberty behind deliberation— I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt with my assistant counsel— Okay! One more thing— Corruptions such an old song that we can sing along in harmony and nowhere is it stronger than in Albany. This colonys economys increasingly stalling and Honestly, thats why public service  seems to be calling me. I practiced the law, I practicly perfected it. Ive seen injustice in the world and Ive corrected it. Now for a strong central democracy, If not, then Ill be Socrates Throwing verbal rocks at these mediocrities. I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention. Now what Im going to say may sound indelicate… Aaron Burr, sir. Can we confer, sir? Yes, and its important to me. Burr, youre a better lawyer than me. I know I talk too much, Im abrasive. Youre incredible in court. Youre succinct, persuasive. My client needs a strong defense. Youre the solution. The new U.S. Constitution? Hear me out. A series of essays, anonymously published, defending the document to the public. I disagree. Burr, thats why we need it. So it needs amendments. So is independence. We have to start somewhere. Youre making a mistake. Hey. What are you waiting for? What do you stall for? We won the war. What was it all for? Do you support this constitution? Then defend it. Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed for the notion of a nation we now get to build. For once in your life, take a stand with pride. I dont understand how you stand to the side. Angelica. How do you write like tomorrow wont arrive? How do you write like you need it to survive? How do you write evry second youre alive? Evry second youre alive? Evry second youre alive? Treasury or State? Treasury or State? Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department? Lets go. I have to leave. Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now. They are asking me to lead. I am not throwin away my shot! I am not throwin away my shot! I am Alexander Hamilton! I am not throwin away my shot! Mr. Jefferson? Alexander Hamilton. Not true! Thomas. That was a real nice declaration.  Welcome to the present, were running a real nation. Would you like to join us, or stay mellow, Doin whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello? If we assume the debts, the union gets A new line of credit, a financial diuretic. How do you not get it? If were aggressive and competitive The union gets a boost. Youd rather give it a sedative? A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor, Your debts are paid cuz you dont pay for labor. “We plant seeds in the South. We create.” Yeah, keep ranting, we know whos really doing the planting. And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment, Dont lecture me about the war, you didnt fight in it. You think Im frightened of you, man? We almost died in a trench while you were off getting high with the French. Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President, reticent—there isnt a plan he doesnt jettison. Madison, youre mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine. Damn, youre in worse shape than the national debt is in, sittin there useless as two shits. Hey, turn around, bend over, Ill show you where my shoe fits. Sir! Im sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather. So we let Congress get held hostage by the South? No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan. James Madison wont talk to me, thats a nonstarter. Theyre being intransigent. But they dont have a plan, they just hate mine! What happens if I dont get congressional approval? Sir— My dearest, Angelica, “tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day” I trust youll understand the reference to another Scottish tragedy without my having to name the play. They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly, Im a polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive pain, Madison is Banquo, Jeffersons Macduff And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to Dunsinane. And there you are, an ocean away. Do you have to live an ocean away? Thoughts of you subside, then I get another letter, I cannot put the notion away… I am on my way. Ill be there in just a minute, save my plate. Okay, okay— What! Uh-huh! Okay! Bravo! Hey, our kid is pretty great. Eliza, Ive got so much on my plate. I know. Id love to go. I will try to get away. “My dearest Angelica” “My dearest, Angelica.” You wont be an ocean away. You will only be a moment away… The Schuyler sisters! Hi. Angelica, tell my wife John Adams doesnt have a real job anyway. Im afraid I cannot join you upstate. You know I have to get my plan through Congress. I lose my job if I dont get my plan through Congress. I have to get my plan through Congress. I cant stop until I get this plan through Congress. I hadnt slept in a week. I was weak, I was awake. You never seen a bastard orphan more in need of a break. Longing for Angelica. Missing my wife. Thats when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said: She said: So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away, she lived a block away, she said: Then I said, “well, I should head back home,” she turned red, she led me to her bed,  let her legs spread and said: Hey… Thats when I began to pray: Lord, show me how to say no to this. I dont know how to say no to this.  But my God, she looks so helpless And her bodys saying, “hell, yes” Nooo, show me how to Say no to this. I dont know how to Say no to this. In my mind, Im tryin to go Then her mouth is on mine, and I dont say… I wish I could say that was the last time. I said that last time. It became a pastime. A month into this endeavor I received a letter from a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said: Fuuuu— I hid the letter and I raced to her place, screamed “How could you?!” in her face,  she said: Half dressed, apologetic. A mess, she looked pathetic, she cried: So was your whole story a setup? Stop crying Goddamnit, get up! I am ruined... I am helpless—how could I do this? I dont want you I dont want you I dont…  Lord, show me how to say no to this. I dont know how to say no to this. Cuz the situations helpless.  And her bodys screaming, “Hell, yes”  No, show me how to say no to this. How can I Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Say no to this? There is nowhere I can go.  When her bodys on mine I do not say… Say no to this… I dont say no to this, there is nowhere I can go. Nobody needs to know. Mister Burr, sir. No. Yeah. Sure. Thats a lot less work. Ha. I guess Im gonna finly have to listen to you. Talk less. Smile more. Do whatever it takes to get my plan on the Congress floor. Well, hate the sin, love the sinner. Im sorry Burr, Ive gotta go. Decisions are happening over dinner. Ive nowhere else to turn! Cuz well have the banks, were in the same spot. And I wanted what I got. When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game. But you dont get a win unless you play in the game. Oh, you get love for it. You get hate for it. You get nothing if you… Wait for it, wait for it, wait! God help and forgive me, I wanna build something thats gonna outlive me.  Burr! Since when are you a Democratic-Republican? No one knows who you are or what you do. Excuse me? Wait. Ive always considered you a friend. You changed parties to run against my father-in-law. You must be out of your Goddamn mind if you think the President is gonna bring the nation to the brink of meddling in the middle of a military mess,  a game of chess, where France is Queen and Kingless. We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket. Would you like to take it out and ask it? “Should we honor our treaty, King Louis head?” “Uh… do whatever you want, Im super dead.” Sir. What? Lafayettes a smart man, hell be fine. And before he was your friend, he was mine. If we try to fight in every revolution in the world, we never stop. Where do we draw the line? Alas, I admit it. My defendants got acquitted. What? Mr. President, you asked to see me? What do you need, sir? Sir? Sir, I dont know what you heard, But whatever it is, Jefferson started it. Youre kidding. Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for his behavior. Ill use the press, Ill write under a pseudonym, youll see what I can do to him— Yes! He resigned. You can finally speak your mind— Ha. Good luck defeating you, sir. Im sorry, what? No, sir, why? Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best time— But— As far as the people are concerned, you have to serve, you could continue to serve— Mr. President, they will say youre weak. Your position is so unique. Why do you have to say goodbye? One last time. Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. I shall also carry with me The hope that my country will view them with indulgence; And that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion, as I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.  I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking, in the midst of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws Under a free government, the ever-favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I trust,  Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers. Teach ‘em how to say goodbye. Sit down, John, you fat motherf— Mr. Vice President. Mr. Madison. Senator Burr. What is this? Is that what you have? Are you done? Ha! You dont even know what youre asking me to confess. You got nothing. I dont have to tell you anything at all. Unless. If I can prove that I never broke the law, do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw? Is that a yes? She courted me. Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner thats when Reynolds extorted me for a sordid fee. I paid him quarterly. I may have mortally wounded my prospects but my papers are orderly! As you can see I kept a record of every check in my checkered History. Check it again against your list n see consistency. I never spent a cent that wasnt mine, you sent the dogs after my scent, thats fine. Yes, I have reasons for shame but I have not committed treason and sullied my good name. As you can see I have done nothing to provoke legal action. Are my answers to your satisfaction? So? Burr! How do I know you wont use this against me the next time we go toe to toe? In the eye of a hurricane there is quiet for just a moment, a yellow sky.  When I was seventeen a hurricane destroyed my town. I didnt drown. I couldnt seem to die.  I wrote my way out, wrote everything down far as I could see. I wrote my way out. I looked up and the town had its eyes on me.  They passed a plate around. Total strangers moved to kindness by my story. Raised enough for me to book passage on a ship that was New York bound…  I wrote my way out of hell. I wrote my way to revolution. I was louder than the crack in the bell. I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell. I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well. And in the face of ignorance and resistance, I wrote financial systems into existence. And when my prayers to God were met with indifference, I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance.  In the eye of a hurricane there is quiet for just a moment, a yellow sky.  I was twelve when my mother died. She was holding me. We were sick and she was holding me. I couldnt seem to die. Ill write my way out…    Write evrything down, far as I can see…    Ill write my way out… Overwhelm them with honesty. This is the eye of the hurricane, this is the only way I can protect my legacy… Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait… The Reynolds Pamphlet. “The charge against me  is a connection with one  James Reynolds! For purposes of improper speculation. My real crime is an  amorous connection with his wife for a considerable time with his knowing consent “I had frequent meetings with her. Most of them at my own house.” “Mrs. Hamilton with our children being absent on a visit to her father.” Angelica— Angelica, thank God. Someone who understands what Im struggling here to do. Hey! At least I was honest with our money! His poor wife. Slow down. Did your friends attempt to negotiate a peace? Where is this happening? Everything is legal in New Jersey… Alright. So this is what youre gonna do: Stand there like a man until Eacker is in front of you. When the time comes, fire your weapon in the air. This will put an end to the whole affair. No. Hell follow suit if hes truly a man of honor. To take someones life, that is something you cant shake. Philip, your mother cant take another heartbreak. Promise me. You dont want this young mans blood on your conscience. Come back home when youre done. Take my guns. Be smart. Make me proud, son. Wheres my son?     Is he alive? Can I see him please? Philip. I know, I know. Shh. I know, I know. Shh. I know you did evrything just right. Shh. I know, I know. I know, I know. I know, Save your strength and Eliza. I spend hours in the garden. I walk alone to the store, and its quiet uptown. I never liked the quiet before. I take the children to church on Sunday, a sign of the cross at the door, and I pray. That never used to happen before. Philip, you would like it uptown. Its quiet uptown. His hair has gone grey. He passes every day. They say he walks the length of the city. You knock me out, I fall apart. Can you imagine? Look at where we are. Look at where we started. I know I dont deserve you, Eliza. But hear me out. That would be enough.  If I could spare his life, If I could trade his life for mine, hed be standing here right now and you would smile, and that would be enough. I dont pretend to know the challenges were facing. I know theres no replacing what weve lost and you need time. But Im not afraid, I know who I married. Just let me stay here by your side, That would be enough. If you see him in the street, walking by her side, talking by her side, have pity. Eliza, do you like it uptown? Its quiet uptown. He is trying to do the unimaginable. See them walking in the park, long after dark, taking in the sights of the city. Look around, look around, Eliza. They are trying to do the unimaginable. Forgiveness. Can you imagine? Forgiveness. Can you imagine? If you see him in the street, walking by her side, talking by her side, have pity. They are going through the unimaginable. Its quiet uptown. Its quiet uptown. Well, if it isnt Aaron Burr. Sir! Youve created quite a stir, sir! Youre openly campaigning? Thats new. Burr— Is there anything you wouldnt do? What? Yo. The people are asking to hear my voice For the country is facing a difficult choice. And if you were to ask me who Id promote— —Jefferson has my vote. I have never agreed with Jefferson once. We have fought on like seventy-five diffrent fronts. But when all is said and all is done, Jefferson has beliefs. Burr has none. Mr. Vice President, I am not the reason no one trusts you. No one knows what you believe. I will not equivocate on my opinion, I have always worn it on my sleeve. Even if I said what you think I said, you would need to cite a more specific grievance. Heres an itemized list of thirty years of disagreements. Hey, I have not been shy. I am just a guy in the public eye Tryin to do my best for our republic. I dont wanna fight, But I wont apologize for doing whats right.  I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant, A dot Ham. Burr, your grievance is legitimate. I stand by what I said, every bit of it. You stand only for yourself. Its what you do. I cant apologize because its true. Youre on. I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant, A dot Ham. I have an early meeting out of town. I know. I just need to write something down. Shhh. Ill be back before you know Im gone. This meetings at dawn. Hey. Best of wives and best of women. Five six seven eight nine— Near the same spot my son died, is that why— Your last chance to negotiate. Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight. I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory. Is this where it gets me, on my feet, sevral feet ahead of me? I see it coming, do I run or fire my gun or let it be? There is no beat, no melody. Burr, my first friend, my enemy, maybe the last face I ever see, If I throw away my shot, is this how you remember me? What if this bullet is my legacy?  Legacy. What is a legacy? Its planting seeds in a garden you never get to see. I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me. America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me. You let me make a difference. A place where even orphan immigrants can leave their fingerprints and rise up. Im running out of time. Im running, and my times up. Wise up. Eyes up. I catch a glimpse of the other side. Laurens leads a soldiers chorus on the other side. My son is on the other side. Hes with my mother on the other side. Washington is watching from the other side.  Teach me how to say goodbye.  Rise up, rise up, rise up, Eliza,  My love, take your time. Ill see you on the other side. Raise a glass to freedom…",alexander hamilton my name is alexander hamilton and theres a million things i havent done but just you wait just you wait just you wait just you wait just you wait pardon

to serve you could continue to president they will say youre weak your position is so unique why do you have to say goodbye one last time though in reviewing the incidents of my administration i am unconscious of intentional error i am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that i may have committed many errors i shall also carry with me the hope that my country will view them with indulgence and that after years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion as i myself must soon be to the mansions of rest i anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which i promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking in the midst of my the benign influence of good laws under a free government the object of my heart and the happy reward as i trust of our mutual cares labors and dangers teach em how to say goodbye sit down john you fat vice president madison senator burr what is this is that what you have are you done ha you dont even know what youre asking me to confess you got nothing i dont have to tell you anything at all unless if i can prove that i never broke the law do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw is that a yes she courted me escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner thats when reynolds extorted me for a sordid fee i paid him quarterly i may have mortally wounded my prospects but my papers are orderly as you can see i kept a record of every check in my checkered history check it again against your list n see consistency i never spent a cent that wasnt mine you sent the dogs after my scent thats fine yes i have reasons for shame but i have not committed treason and sullied my good name as you can see i have done nothing to provoke legal action are my answers to your satisfaction so burr how do i know you wont use this against me the next time we go toe to toe in the eye of a hurricane there is quiet

of hell i wrote my way to revolution i was louder than the crack in the bell i wrote eliza love letters until she fell i wrote about the constitution and defended it well and in the face of ignorance and resistance i wrote financial systems into existence and when my prayers to god were met with indifference i picked up a pen i wrote my own deliverance in the eye of a hurricane there is quiet for just a moment a yellow sky i was twelve when my mother died she was holding me we were sick and she was holding me i couldnt seem to die ill write my way write evrything down far as i can ill write my way overwhelm them with honesty this is the eye of the hurricane this is the only way i can protect my wait for it wait for it wait for it the reynolds pamphlet the charge against me is a connection

of them at my own mrs hamilton with our children being absent on a visit to her angelica thank god someone who understands what im struggling here to do hey at least i was honest with our money his poor wife slow down did your friends attempt to negotiate a peace where is this happening everything is legal in new alright so this is what youre gon na do stand there like a man until eacker is in

jefferson,"And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up. Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of, the brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow or barter. France is following us to revolution, there is no more status quo. But the sun comes up and the world still spins. I helped Lafayette draft a declaration, then I said, ‘I gotta go. I gotta be in Monticello. Now the work at home begins… So whatd I miss? Whatd I miss? Virginia, my home sweet home, I wanna give you a kiss. Ive been in Paris meeting lots of different ladies... I guess I basiclly missed the late eighties... I traveled the wide, wide world and came back to this… Theres a letter on my desk from the President. Havent even put my bags down yet. Sally be a lamb, darlin, wontcha open it? It says the Presidents assembling a cabinet and that I am to be the Secretary of State, great! And that Im already Senate-approved... I just got home and now Im headed up to New York. Lookin at the rolling fields I cant believe that we are free. Ready to face whatevers awaiting me in N.Y.C. But whos waitin for me when I step in the place? My friend James Madison, red in the face. He grabs my arm and I respond,  “Whats goin on?” Uh...France. Whatd I miss? Whatd I miss? Headfirst into a political abyss! I have my first cabinet meeting today, I guess I better think of something to say, Im already on my way, lets get to the bottom of this… So what did I miss? ‘Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We fought for these ideals; we shouldnt settle for less. These are wise words, enterprising men quote ‘em. Dont act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote ‘em. Oww But Hamilton forgets his plan would have the government assume states debts. Now, place your bets as to who that benefits: the very seat of government where Hamilton sits. Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it. If New Yorks in debt— why should Virginia bear it? Uh! Our debts are paid, Im afraid. Dont tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade. In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground. We create. You just wanna move our money around. This financial plan is an outrageous demand, and its too many damn pages for any man to understand. Stand with me in the land of the free and pray to God we never see Hamiltons candidacy. Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky. Imagine what gon happen when you try to tax our whisky. You dont have the votes. Aha-ha-ha ha! Youre gonna need congressional approval and you dont have the votes. Such a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder. Alexander was on Washingtons doorstep one day in distress ‘n disarray. Alexander said— And basicly begged me to join the fray. I approached Madison and saids— “I know you hate ‘im, but lets hear what he has to say.” Well, I arranged the meeting. I arranged the menu, the venue, the seating, Oh-ho! I suppose. Actually, I would. And youll provide him his votes? Lets go.  When we were on deaths door, when we were needy, we made a promise, we signed a treaty. We needed money and guns and half a chance. Who provided those funds? In return, they didnt ask for land, only a promise that wed lend a hand and stand with them if they fought against oppressors, and revolution is messy but now is the time to stand. Stand with our brothers as they fight against tyranny. I know that Alexander Hamilton is here and he would rather not have this debate. Ill remind you that he is not Secretary of State. He knows nothing of loyalty, smells like new money, dresses like fake royalty, desperate to rise above his station, everything he does betrays the ideals of our nation. Hey, and if ya dont know, now ya know, Mr. President. Mr. President— But sir, do we not fight for freedom? The people are leading— Did you forget Lafayette? Have you an ounce of regret? You accumulate debt, you accumulate power, yet in their hour of need, you forget. So quick-witted. I bet you were quite a lawyer. Huh. Well, someone oughta remind you. Youre nothing without Washington behind you. Daddys calling. Evry action has its equal, opposite reactions. Thanks to Hamilton, our cabnets fractured into factions. Try not to crack under the stress, were breaking down like fractions. We smack each other in the press, and we dont print retractions. I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion. The way he primps and preens and dresses like the pits of fashion. Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration to ration as Wall Street robs ‘em blind in search of chips to cash in. This prick is askin for someone to bring him to task. Somebody gimme some dirt on this vacuous mass so we can at last unmask him. Ill pull the trigger on him, someone load the gun and cock it. While we were all watching, he got Washington in his pocket. It must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side. It must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side.  Look back at the Bill of Rights. The ink hasnt dried. It must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side. See how he lies. Centralizing national credit and making American credit competitive. I have to resign. If theres a fire youre trying to douse, You cant put it out from inside the house. Im in the cabinet. I am complicit in watching him grabbin at power and kiss it. If Washington isnt gon listen to disciplined dissidents, this is the difference: This kid is out! Oh! This immigrant isnt somebody we chose. Oh! This immigrants keeping us all on our toes. Oh! Lets show these Federalists who theyre up against! Oh! Southern motherfuckin— Democratic-Republicans! Oh! Lets follow the money and see where it goes. Because every second the Treasury grows. If we follow the money and see where it leads, get in the weeds, look for the seeds of Hamiltons misdeeds. It must be nice. It must be nice. It must be nice. It must be nice. The emperor has no clothes. We wont be invisible. We wont be denied. Still, it must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side. Washington cant help you now, no more mister nice President. Say what?! Hamiltons a host unto himself. As long as he can hold a pen, hes a threat. Lets let him know what we know. We have the check stubs. From separate accounts… Though ‘virtue is not a word Id apply to this situation— And the evidence suggests youve engaged in speculation— I can almost see the headline, your career is done. Ya best gwan run back where ya come from. Confess. Unless? Um, yes. Whaaaat— My God. The people wont know what we know. Have you read this? Alexander Hamilton had a torrid affair. And he wrote it down right there. “The charge against me  is a connection with one  James Reynolds! For purposes of improper speculation. My real crime is an  amorous connection with his wife for a considerable time with his knowing consent Damn! “I had frequent meetings with her. Most of them at my own house.” “Mrs. Hamilton with our children being absent on a visit to her father.” Well, hes never gon be President now. Well, hes never gon be President now. Hes never gon be President now. Thats one less thing to worry about. Thats one less thing to worry about! What?! Well, hes never gon be President now. Well, hes never gon be President now. Well, hes never gon be President now. Thats one less thing to worry about.  Have you read this? You ever see somebody ruin their own life? Can we get back to politics? Yo. Evry action has an equal, opposite reaction. John Adams shat the bed. I love the guy, but hes in traction. Poor Alexander Hamilton? He is missing in action. So now Im facing— Aaron Burr! With his own faction. Hes not very forthcoming on any particular stances. And they say Im a Francophile: at least they know I know where France is! Ha! Who did you have in mind? Who is it? Whaaaat. It might be nice, it might be nice To get Hamilton on your side. Its up to the delegates! Its up to Hamilton! Oh! Oh! Oh! Well, Ill be damned. Well, Ill be damned. And? Uh-huh. Our partnership? Ha. Yeah, right. You hear this guy? Man openly campaigns against me, talkin bout, “I look forward to our partnership.” Yeah, you know what? We can change that. You know why? ‘cuz Im the President. Hey, Burr, when you see Hamilton, thank him for the endorsement. Ill give him this: his financial system is a work of genius. I couldnt undo it if I tried. And I tried.",and every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted away across the waves he struggled and kept his guard up inside he was longing for something to be a part of the brother was

Im sorry, Im a Hamilton with pride. You talk about my father, I cannot let it slide. Mister Eacker! How was the rest of your show? Confer with your men. The duel will commence after we count to ten.

burr,"How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar? Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man” took up a collection just to send him to the mainland. “Get your education, dont forget from whence you came, and the world is gonna know your name. Whats your name, man?” There would have been nothin left to do for someone less astute, he woulda been dead or destitute without a cent of restitution, started workin, clerkin for his late mothers landlord, tradin sugar cane and rum and all the things he cant afford scammin for every book he can get his hands on, plannin for the future see him now as he stands on  the bow of a ship headed for a new land, In New York you can be a new man. The ship is in the harbor now,  see if you can spot him. Another immigrant,  comin up from the bottom. His enemies destroyed his rep,  America forgot him And me? Im the damn fool that shot him. Whats your name, man? That depends. Whos asking? Im getting nervous. You punched the bursar. It was my parents dying wish before they passed. Can I buy you a drink? While were talking, let me offer you some free advice. Talk less. Smile more. Dont let them know what youre against or what youre for. You wanna get ahead? Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead. …like I said… Good luck with that: youre takin a stand. You spit. Im ‘a sit. Well see where we land. Geniuses, lower your voices. You keep out of trouble and you double your choices. Im with you, but the situation is fraught. Youve got to be carefully taught: If you talk, youre gonna get shot! Theres nothing rich folks love more than going downtown and slummin it with the poor. They pull up in their carriages and gawk at the students in the common Just to watch them talk. Take Philip Schuyler: the man is loaded. Uh-oh, but little does he know that his daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at— Wooh! Theres nothin like summer in the city. Someone in a rush next to someone lookin pretty. Excuse me, miss, I know its not funny But your perfume smells like your daddys got money. Why you slummin in the city in your fancy heels You searchin for an urchin who can give you ideals? Ah, so youve discussed me. Im a trust fund, baby, you can trust me! Let him be. Alexander, please! Rise up! Rise up! Rise up! Rise up! Rise up! Ladies and gentlemen! The moment youve been waiting for! The pride of Mount Vernon! George Washington! Your excellency, sir! Aaron Burr, Sir? Permission to state my case? Sir, I was a captain under General Montgomery until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec, and well, in summary I think that I could be of some assistance. I admire how you keep firing on the British from a distance. I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west. Well— We keep meeting. As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out. Sir? How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore, go on and on, grow into more of a phenomenon? Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother be seated at the right hand of the father. Washington hires Hamilton right on sight, But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write. Now Hamiltons skill with a quill is undeniable But what do we have in common? Were reliable with the There are so many to deflower. Looks! Proximity to power. They delighted and distracted him. Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him! A winters ball and the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all. Yo, if you can marry a sister, youre rich, son. Hey Hey Hey hey Hey hey hey hey Sir! To be sure. I came to say congratulations. I see the whole gang is here. No, you dont. Now, be sensible. From what I hear, youve made yourself indispensable. I should go. Youre very kind, but Im afraid its unlawful, sir. Shes married. Shes married to a British officer. Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more. Ill see you on the other side of the war. Ill see you on the other side of the war. Theodosia writes me a letter evry day. Im keeping her bed warm while her husband is away. Hes on the British side in Georgia. Hes tryin to keep the colonies in line. He can keep all of Georgia. Theodosia, shes mine.  Love doesnt discriminate between the sinners and the saints, it takes and it takes and it takes and we keep loving anyway. We laugh and we cry and we break and we make our mistakes. And if theres a reason Im by her side when so many have tried then Im willing to wait for it. Im willing to wait for it. My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher But there are things that the homilies and hymns wont teach ya My mother was a genius My father commanded respect When they died they left no instructions. Just a legacy to protect. Death doesnt discriminate between the sinners and the saints, it takes and it takes and it takes and we keep living anyway. We rise and we fall and we break and we make our mistakes. And if theres a reason Im still alive when everyone who loves me has died Im willing to wait for it. Im willing to wait for it.  Wait for it I am the one thing in life I can control I am inimitable I am an original Im not falling behind or running late Im not standing still, I am lying in wait Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb He has something to prove he has nothing to lose Hamiltons pace is relentless, he wastes no time What is it like in his shoes?  Hamilton doesnt hesitate. He exhibits no restraint. He takes and he takes and he takes and he keeps winning anyway. He changes the game. He plays and he raises the stakes. And if theres a reason he seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit— Im willing to wait for it. Im willing to wait for it… Life doesnt discriminate between the sinners and the saints, it takes and it takes and it takes. We rise We fall and if theres a reason Im still alive when so many have died, then Im willin to— Wait for it… Wait for it... Its the Ten Duel Commandments. Negotiate a peace… This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits. You have him turn around so he can have deniability. Your last chance to negotiate. Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight… Alexander. Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature? With his life? We both know thats absurd, sir. Okay, so were doin this. Number Fire! You shot him in the side! Yes, he yields! Yo, we gotta clear the field! This should be fun. Yes, sir. Lets ride! How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower somehow defeat a global superpower? How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire? Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross flag higher? Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon! An immigrant you know and love whos unafraid to step in! Hes constantly confusin, confoundin the British henchmen. Evryone give it up for Americas favorite fighting Frenchman! Dear Theodosia, what to say to you? You have my eyes. You have your mothers name.  When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart.  Im dedicating every day to you. Domestic life was never quite my style. When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart. And I thought I was so smart.  You will come of age with our young nation. Well bleed and fight for you, well make it right for you. If we lay a strong enough foundation well pass it on to you, well give the world to you, and youll blow us all away… someday, someday. Yeah, youll blow us all away, someday, someday. My father wasnt around. Ill be around for you. Ill make a million mistakes. Ill make the world safe and sound for you… …will come of age with our young nation. Well bleed and fight for you, well make it right for you.  If we lay a strong enough foundation well pass it on to you, well give the world to you, and youll blow us all away... someday, someday. Yeah, youll blow us all away, someday, someday. After the war I went back to New York. I finished up my studies and I practiced law. Even though we started at the very same time, Alexander Hamilton began to climb. How to account for his rise to the top? Maaaaan, the man is non-stop! Co-counsel. Hamilton, sit down. Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness. Thats all you had to say! Why do you assume youre the smartest in the room? Why do you assume youre the smartest in the room? Why do you assume youre the smartest in the room? Soon that attitude may be your doom! Why do you write like youre running out of time? Write day and night like youre running out of time? Evry day you fight, like youre running out of time. Keep on fighting. In the meantime— Hes just Non-stop! Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention: There as a New York junior delegate: Goes and proposes his own form of government! His own plan for a new form of government! Talks for six hours! The convention is listless! Why do you always say what you believe? Why do you always say what you believe? Evry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies! Why do you write like its going out of style? Write day and night like its going out of style? Evry day you fight like its going out of style. Do what you do. Alexander? Its the middle of the night. Is this a legal matter? What do you need? Okay. Whos your client? No. No way! No one will read it. And if it fails? The constitutions a mess. Its full of contradictions. No. No way. Good night. What? Of course. And what if youre backing the wrong horse? Ill keep all my plans close to my chest. Ill wait here and see which way the wind will blow. Im taking my time, watching the afterbirth of a nation, watching the tension grow. Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one! How do you write like youre running out of time? Write day and night like youre running out of time? Evry day you fight, like youre running out of time, like youre running out of time, are you  running out of time? Why do you assume youre the smartest in the room? Why do you assume youre the smartest in the room? Why do you assume youre the smartest in the room? Soon that attitudes gonna be your doom! Why do you fight like youre running out of time? Why do you fight like history has its eyes on you… How does the bastard orphan, immigrant decorated war vet unite the colonies through more debt? Fight the other founding fathers til he has to forfeit? Have it all, lose it all, you ready for more yet? Treasury Secretary. Washingtons the President, evry American experiment sets a precedent. Not so fast. Someone came along to resist him. Pissed him off until we had a two-party system. You havent met him yet, you havent had the chance, ‘cause hes been kickin ass as the ambassador to France but someones gotta keep the American promise. You simply must meet Thomas. Thomas! Theres nothing like summer in the city. Someone under stress meets someone looking pretty. Theres trouble in the air, you can smell it. and Alexanders by himself. Ill let him tell it. Ah, Mister Secretary. Didja hear the news about good old General Mercer? You know Clermont Street? They renamed it after him. The Mercer legacy is secure. And all he had to do was die. We oughta give it a try. Now howre you gonna get your debt plan through? Really? Ha. Now, Madison and Jefferson are merciless. But— Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room. Diametricly opposed, foes. They emerge with a compromise, having opened doors that were Previously closed, The immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power, a system he can shape however he wants. The Virginians emerge with the nations capital. And heres the pièce de résistance: No one else was in  the room where it happened. The room where it happened. The room where it happened. No one else was in  the room where it happened. The room where it happened. The room where it happened. No one really knows how the game is played, The art of the trade,  how the sausage gets made. We just assume that it happens. But no one else is in the room where it happens. Thomas claims— Thomas claims— Thomas claims— Thomas claims— But! No one else was in— The room where it happened. The room where it happened. The room where it happened. No one else was in— The room where it happened. The room where it happened. The room where it happened. No one really knows how the parties get to yesssss. The pieces that are sacrificed in evry game of chesssss. We just assume that it happens. But no one else is in the room where it happens. Meanwhile— Madison is grappling with the fact that not evry issue can be settled by committee. Congress is fighting over where to put the capital—  Company screams in chaos. It isnt pretty. Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite, And Madison responds with Virginian insight: No! The room where it happened. The room where it happened. No one else was in the room where it happened. The room where it happened. The room where it happened. My God! In God we trust. But well never really know what got discussed. Click-boom then it happened. And no one else was in the room where it happened. What did they say to you to get you to sell New York City down the river? Did Washington know about the dinner? Was there Presidential pressure to deliver? Or did you know, even then, it doesnt matter where you put the U.S. Capital? You got more than you gave. I wanna be in the room where it happens. The room where it happens. I  wanna be in the room where it happens. The room where it happens. I Hold your nose and close your eyes. But we dont get a say in what they trade away. But we dream in the dark for the most part. Dark as a tomb where it happens. Ive got to be in the room… Ive got to be... Since being one put me on the up and up again. They dont need to know me. They dont like you. Oh, Wall Street thinks youre great. Youll always be adored by the things you create. But upstate, People think youre crooked! And Schuylers seat was up for grabs, so I took it. I dont see why that has to end! I changed parties to seize the opportunity I saw. I swear, your pride will be the death of us all! Beware: it goeth before the fall… It must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side It must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side. It must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side. It must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side.  Look back at the Bill of Rights. The ink hasnt dried. It must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side. Look in his eyes! Somebody has to stand up to his mouth! Oh! This immigrant isnt somebody we chose. Oh! This immigrants keeping us all on our toes. Oh! Lets show these Federalists who theyre up against! Oh! Democratic-Republicans! Oh! Lets follow the money and see where it goes. Because every second the Treasury grows. If we follow the money and see where it leads, get in the weeds, look for the seeds of Hamiltons misdeeds. It must be nice. It must be nice. It must be nice. It must be nice. We wont be invisible. We wont be denied. Still, it must be nice, it must be nice to have Washington on your side. How does Hamilton, the short-tempered, protean creator of the Coast Guard, Founder of the New York Post, ardently abuse his cabnet post, destroy his reputation? Welcome, folks, to The Adams administration! Jeffersons the runner-up, which makes him the Vice President. Adams fires Hamilton. Privately calls him “creole bastard” in his taunts. Hamilton publishes his response. Hamilton is out of control. To a Mr. James Reynolds way back in seventeen ninety-one. An immigrant embezzling our government funds— I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons. Ya best gwan run back where ya come from. Confess. Unless? No one else was in the room where it happened. Um, yes. “Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health and in a prosperous enough position to put wealth in the pockets of people like me: down on their luck. You see, it was my wife who you decided to—” Alexander, rumors only grow. And we both know what we know. Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it… Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it… Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait… Alexander Hamilton had a torrid affair. And he wrote it down right there. My real crime is an  amorous connection with his wife Damn! At his own house! No… Have you read this? Never gon be President now. Never gon be President now. Never gon be President now. Thats one less thing to worry about! Well, hes never gon be President now. Well, hes never gon be President now. Well, hes never gon be President now. Thats one less thing to worry about. Have you read this? You ever see somebody ruin their own life? Talk less! Smile more! Dont let ‘em know what youre against or what youre for! Shake hands with him! Charm her! Its eighteen hundred, ladies, tell your husbands: vote for Burr! Alexander! Im going door to door! Sure! Honestly, its kind of draining. Sir! No. Im chasing what I want. And you know what? I learned that from you. Congrats on a race well-run. I did give you a fight. I look forward to our partnership. As your vice-President. How does Hamilton, an arrogant, immigrant, orphan, bastard, whoreson, somehow endorse Thomas Jefferson, his enemy, a man hes despised since the beginning, just to keep me from winning? I wanna be in the room where it happens— The room where it happens. The room where it happens. Youve kept me from— The room where it happens. For the last time.  Dear Alexander:  I am slow to anger, but I toe the line as I reckon with the effects of your life on mine. I look back on where I failed, and in every place I checked, the only common thread has been your disrespect. Now you call me “amoral,” a “dangerous disgrace,” if youve got something to say, name a time and place, face to face.  I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant, A dot Burr. Sweet Jesus. Careful how you proceed, good man. Intemperate indeed, good man. Answer for the accusations I lay at your feet or prepare to bleed, good man. Then stand, Alexander. Weehawken. Dawn. Guns. Drawn. I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant, A dot Burr. Five six seven eight nine— There are ten things you need to know. We rowed across the Hudson at dawn. My friend, William P. Van Ness signed on as my— Number two! Hamilton arrived with his crew: Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew. I watched Hamilton examine the terrain. I wish I could tell you what was happning in his brain. This man has poisoned my political pursuits! Hamilton drew first position. Looking, to the world, like a man on a mission. This is a soldier with a marksmans ability. The doctor turned around so he could have deniability. Now I didnt know this at the time But we were— Near the same spot your son died, is that why— He examined his gun with such rigor? I watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger. Confession time? Heres what I got: My fellow soldiersll tell you Im a terrible shot. Your last chance to negotiate. Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight. They wont teach you this in your classes, but look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses. Why? If not to take deadly aim? Its him or me, the world will never be the same. I had only one thought before the slaughter: This man will not make an orphan of my daughter. Look him in the eye, aim no higher. Summon all the courage you require. Then count: He aims his pistol at the sky— Wait! I strike him right between his ribs. I walk towards him, but I am ushered away. They row him back across the Hudson. I get a drink. I hear wailing in the streets. Somebody tells me, “Youd better hide.” They say Angelica and Eliza— Were both at his side when he died. Death doesnt discriminate between the sinners and the saints, it takes and it takes and it takes. History obliterates. In every picture it paints, it paints me with all my mistakes. When Alexander aimed at the sky, he may have been the first one to die, but Im the one who paid for it.  I survived, but I paid for it.  Now Im the villain in your history. I was too young and blind to see... I shouldve known. I shouldve known the world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me. The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me. President Jefferson: President Madison: And when youre gone, who remembers your name? Who keeps your flame? Who tells your story? Who tells your story?",how does a bastard orphan son of a whore and a scotsman dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot in the caribbean by providence impoverished in squalor grow up to be a hero and

angelica,"Me? I loved him. Angelica! Angelica! Daddy doesnt need to know. But—look around, look around, the revolutions happening in New York. New ideas in the air. Look around, look around— Eliza, Im lookin for a mind at work. Im lookin for a mind at work! Im lookin for a mind at work! Whooaaaaa! Whooaaaaa! Work! Burr, you disgust me. Ive been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine. So men say that Im intense or Im insane. You want a revolution? I want a revelation So listen to my declaration: “We hold these truths to be self-evident That all men are created equal” And when I meet Thomas Jefferson, Im ‘a compel him to include women in the sequel! History is happening in Manhattan and we just happen to be in the greatest city in the world! Cuz Ive been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine. So men say that Im intense or Im insane. You want a revolution? I want a revelation So listen to my declaration: We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal Whoo! Angelica! The Schuyler sisters! Were looking for a mind at work! Hey! Hey! Whoa!   In the greatest  city in the world Whoa, whoa, whoa... Whoa, whoa, whoa...  Im about to change your life. My sister. Ill leave you to it. Im just sayin, if you really loved me, you would share him. A toast to the groom! To the bride! From your sister, who is always by your side. To your union, and the hope that you provide. May you always… be satisfied. I remember that night, I just might regret that night for the rest of my days.  I remember those soldier boys tripping over themselves to win our praise.  I remember that dreamlike candlelight like a dream that you cant quite place,  but Alexander, Ill never forget the first time I saw your face.  I have never been the same, Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame, And when you said “Hi,” I forgot my dang name, set my heart aflame, evry part aflame, Im sure I dont know what you mean. You forget yourself. Is that right? My name is Angelica Schuyler. Wheres your famly from? So so so— so this is what it feels like to match wits with someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? Its the feeling of freedom, of seein the light, its Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right? The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes, evrything we said in total agreement, its a dream and its a bit of a dance, a bit of a posture, its a bit of a stance. Hes a bit of a flirt, but Im ‘a give it a chance. I asked about his famly, did you see his answer? His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance? Hes penniless, hes flying by the seat of his pants.  Handsome, boy, does he know it! Peach fuzz, and he cant even grow it! I wanna take him far away from this place, then I turn and see my sisters face and she is… And I know she is… And her eyes are just… And I realize Three fundamental truths at the exact same time… Im about to change your life. Number one! Im a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich. My father has no sons so Im the one who has to social climb for one, so Im the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in New York City is insidious, And Alexander is penniless, Ha! That doesnt mean I want him any less. My sister. Hes after me cuz Im a Schuyler sister. That elevates his status, Id have to be naïve to set that aside, maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza, now thats his bride. Nice going, Angelica, he was right, You will never be satisfied. Ill leave you to it. I know my sister like I know my own mind, you will never find anyone as trusting or as kind. If I tell her that I love him shed be silently resigned, hed be mine. She would say, “Im fine” Shed be lying. But when I fantasize at night its Alexanders eyes, as I romanticize what might have been if I hadnt sized him up so quickly. At least my dear Elizas his wife; at least I keep his eyes in my life… To the groom! To the bride! From your sister, who is always by your side. To your union, and the hope that you provide. He will never be satisfied. I will never be satisfied. Stay alive… Stay alive... he promotes Charles Lee. Makes him second-in-command: I am sailing off to London. Im accompanied by someone who always pays. I have found a wealthy husband who will keep me in comfort for all my days. He is not a lot of fun, but theres no one who can match you for turn of phrase. My Alexander. Dont forget to write. He will never be satisfied,  he will never be satisfied, satisfied, satisfied… He will never be satisfied, satisfied, satisfied… Why do you fight like history has its eyes on you… And there you are, an ocean away. Do you have to live an ocean away? Thoughts of you subside, then I get another letter, I cannot put the notion away… My dearest Alexander, You must get through to Jefferson. Sit down with him and compromise, dont stop ‘til you agree your favrite older sister, Angelica, reminds you theres someone in your corner all the way across the sea.  In a letter I received from you two weeks ago I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase. It changed the meaning. Did you intend this? One stroke and youve consumed my waking days. It says: “My dearest Angelica” With a comma after “dearest.” Youve written “My dearest, Angelica.” Anyway, all this to say Im coming home this summer at my sisters invitation, Ill be there with your famly if you make your way upstate. I know youre very busy, I know your works important, but Im crossing the ocean and I just cant wait. You wont be an ocean away. You will only be a moment away… Eliza! Alexander. Its good to see your face. …youre not joining us? Wait. Alexander, I came all this way. All this way— Take a break. Run away with us for the summer. Lets go upstate. We can all go stay with our father. I know Ill miss your face— Screw your courage to the sticking place— Elizas right— Take a break. Run away with us for the summer— Lets go upstate. We can all go stay with our father, Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now— We can go— When the night gets dark. Take a break. if you take your time— you will make your mark. Close your eyes and dream— when the night gets dark. Take a break. History has its eyes on you. Have you read this? I came as soon as I heard. Im not here for you. I know my sister like I know my own mind, you will never find anyone as trusting or as kind. I love my sister more than anything in this life, I will choose her happiness over mine every time. Put what we had aside. Im standing at her side. You could never be satisfied. God, I hope youre satisfied. There are moments that the words dont reach. There is suffering too terrible to name. You hold your child as tight as you can and push away the unimaginable. The moments when youre in so deep, it feels easier to just swim down. The Hamiltons move uptown and learn to live with the unimaginable. If you see him in the street, walking by himself, talking to himself, have pity. He is working through the unimaginable. There are moments that the words dont reach. There is a grace too powerful to name. We push away what we can never understand, we push away the unimaginable. They are standing in the garden, Alexander by Elizas side. She takes his hand. Angelica and Eliza— Every other founding father story gets told. Every other founding father gets to grow old. Who tells your story? Your story? Angelica. We tell your story. Near you.",me i loved him angelica angelica daddy doesnt need to know around look around the revolutions happening in new york new ideas in the air look around look eliza im lookin for a mind at work
